# Lua-Basic-Tutorial
This tutorial follows John Sonmez [Youtube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwn1Vkez7og&list=PLysdvSvCcUhZ3d2AEF4XVAdAyQSBxLNRT&index=1) for basics of Lua.
  
## What is the Lua?
**Lua** is a lightweight, high-level, multi-paradigm programming language designed primarily for embedded use in applications. Lua is cross-platform, since the interpreter of compiled bytecode is writtten in ANSI C, and Lua has a relatively simple C API to embed it into applications.  
  
Lua was originally designed in 1993 as a language for extending software applicationss to meet the increasing demand for customization at the time. It provided the basic facilities of most procedural programming languages, but more complicated or domain-specific features were not included; rather, it included mechanisms for extending the language, allowing programmers to implement such features. As Lua was intended to be a general embeddable extension language, the designers of Lua focused on improving its speed, portability, extensibility, and ease-of-use in development. (from wikipedia)
